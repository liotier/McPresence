# McPresence.sh - cheap & easy presence detection
#
# Reads known persons' personal mobile device's MAC address
# against the localhost's DHCP leases
# to check each person's presence.
#
# Then sends each person's presence to an Openhab instance
#
# The dhcp-lease-list command is part of the ISC DHCP server's package 
# For other DHCP servers, maybe use libtext-dhcpleases-perl instead
#
# The personal_mobile_devices file takes two columns: MAC address and person
# MAC address must be lowercase - matching is case sensitive. Example:
# 7c:2f:80:0d:3b:a6 Alice
# 55:55:55:55:55:55 Bob
#
# The people's presence in Openhab is modeled as switches
# which are Openhab items recorded in /etc/openhab2/items
# For example, here is the content of a /etc/openhab2/items/people.items
# Switch Alice_presence
#Â Switch Bob_presence
#
# This script is meant to be called from crontab - every minute is adequate.
#
# Absence detection requires DHCP lease expiration - by default ten minutes in ISC DHCP
